You need a svn client program to check out the source code for projects
hosted on http://code.google.com. Most Linux systems should already have svn
client installed and the following command should work:

`svn checkout http://gmmreg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gmmreg-read-only`

Windows users are recommended to use [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/). For how to use TortoiseSVN, there is a nice [introduction](http://code.google.com/p/ulipad/wiki/SvnHowTo) by [limodou](http://code.google.com/u/limodou.project/), the author of [UliPad](http://code.google.com/p/ulipad/).

Note that the "URL of repository" for this project should be
> http://gmmreg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
