# Robust Point Set Registration Using Gaussian Mixture Models #
Copyright (C) 2005-2013 Bing Jian and Baba C. Vemuri

## Description ##
This website hosts implementations of the robust point set registration
algorithm described in the paper
[Robust Point Set Registration Using Gaussian Mixture Models](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Robust+point+set+registration+using+gaussian+mixture+models), _Bing Jian_ and _Baba C. Vemuri_,
IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2011, 33(8), pp. 1633-1645.  (An earlier conference version of this work appeared in the
proceedings of ICCV'05 [A Robust Algorithm for Point Set Registration Using Mixture of Gaussians](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=robust+algorithm+point+set+registration+mixture+gaussians), _Bing Jian_ and _Baba C. Vemuri_.)

Currently we provide implementations in [C++](http://code.google.com/p/gmmreg/source/browse/#svn/trunk/C++), [MATLAB](http://code.google.com/p/gmmreg/source/browse/#svn/trunk/MATLAB), and [Python](http://code.google.com/p/gmmreg/source/browse/#svn/trunk/Python), with full
source code. Windows executable, example data sets, and MATLAB demo scripts are available for
[download](http://code.google.com/p/gmmreg/downloads/list).

You can download the source code for free, use and change it as
you like, but please refer to this website and [cite our papers](http://gmmreg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gmmreg_bib.txt).
